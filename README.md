Node.js exam
====

Quick practical exam for node.js candidates.

Requirements
----

- allow the user to supply a CLI argument containing a comma-separated list of tags
  - if no argument is given, load `tags.txt` to get an array of tags.
- for each of these tags, find out how many times that tag appears within the objects in `data/*.json` (_note:_ objects can be nested).
- final output should be formatted like this (sorted by most popular tag first):

```
pizza     15
spoon     2
umbrella  0
cats      0
```

- cache the result so that subsequent runs can return the result immediately without needing to process the files.
- use only core modules
- use the asynchronous variants of the file IO functions (eg. use `fs.readFile` not `fs.readFileSync`).
- if any of the data files contain invalid JSON, log the error with `console.error` and continue, ignoring that file.
- you can use any version of node, however your solution must use plain callbacks rather than promises.
